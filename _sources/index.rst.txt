Welcome to Atoman
=================

Atoman can be used to analyse and visualise atomistic simulations, such as
molecular dynamics simulations.

It has the ability to calculate a number of properties for a system on a per
atom basis, such as coordination number or Voronoi volume for example, and can
filter the atoms so that only those atoms with properties within a certain
range are shown.

Atoman also allows you to plot the distributions of calculated properties and
can export images and create movies by reading in sequences of files.

The installation process and usage of Atoman are documented here.
